title: Fix the token not found bug during `create`
category: fixed
author: Venu Vardhan Reddy Tekula <venu@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
    The token is required if you are creating the dev
    setup but not required for updating. So, it was
    marked not required. But, the create operation
    terminates abruptly is the token is missing.

    This code covers the exception and shows info about
    adding the token.
