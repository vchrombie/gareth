## gareth 0.1.0 - (2021-04-26)

**New features:**

 * Add the initial structure of the tool\
   The initial structure of the tool is added. The tool is built using
   click. The arguments are source, token, and the operation which can be
   create or update. Usage: ``` $ gareth --help ```
 * Add support for creating the dev environment\
   The support for creating the developer environment is added. This
   feature would automate most of the  process of the setup. It forks all
   the grimoirelab repositories using the token and clones them to the
   local machine into a  given source. Later, it sets the upstream to all
   the repositories accordingly. Usage: ``` $ gareth -t xxxx -s sources
   --create ```
 * Add support for updating the dev environment\
   The support for updating the developer environment is added. This
   would be needed to update the repos by rebasing the latest changes
   with the upstream. It would open each folder, changes to `master`
   branch, and rebase the changes with the upstream. Usage: ``` $ gareth
   -s sources --update ```

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix the token not found bug during `create`\
   The token is required if you are creating the dev setup but not
   required for updating. So, it was marked not required. But, the create
   operation terminates abruptly is the token is missing. This code
   covers the exception and shows info about adding the token.
